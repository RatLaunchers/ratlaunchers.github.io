mission:
    Because the CanSat Design Challenge will be launching satellites in Calgary, we were inspired by the recent and ongoing catastrophic wildfires in the area. We are using various sensors and a camera system to record images and other data. This is done in order to analyse and predict wildfire risk based on variables such as plant colour, humidity, meteorological conditions and other factors. <br><br>

    The data collected will be used in an interactive simulation program that will allow the user to model wildfires under different conditions by changing various parameters. This will allow the user to identify the vulnerability of an area to wildfires and potentially look for solutions to mitigate risk by better understanding the shortcomings of their current fire prevention strategy. The simulation can be accessed here.
